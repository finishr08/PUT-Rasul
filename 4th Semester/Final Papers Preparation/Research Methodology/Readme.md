## What is Sampling?

Sampling involves selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population to represent the whole. It aims to collect representative data and employs various techniques based on the context.

For example, a drug manufacturer might want to study the adverse side effects of a drug on the country's population by selecting a sample from that population.

## Types of Sampling Techniques

### 1. Probability Sampling

In probability sampling, members of the population are chosen randomly, giving each individual an equal chance of being selected. This method ensures a representative sample.

#### Examples:

1. **Simple Random Sampling**: Each of the 500 employees in a company has an equal chance of being selected.
2. **Cluster Sampling**: Dividing the population into clusters based on states (e.g., California, Texas) and randomly selecting clusters for the sample.
3. **Systematic Sampling**: Selecting every 10th person from a numbered list of 5000 individuals to get a sample of 500.
4. **Stratified Sampling**: Creating groups based on annual income ranges and selecting samples from each group (e.g., less than $20,000, $21,000–$30,000, etc.).

### 2. Non-Probability Sampling

Non-probability sampling involves selecting samples based on the researcher’s judgment rather than random selection. This method often leads to biased results.

#### Examples:

1. **Convenience Sampling**: Asking fellow students after each class to fill out a survey.
2. **Voluntary Response Sampling**: People volunteer to participate in a survey (e.g., responding to an online poll).
3. **Quota Sampling**: Interviewers are given a quota of subjects to recruit based on specific characteristics (e.g., 20 adult men, 20 adult women).
4. **Snowball Sampling**: Existing subjects nominate other subjects, commonly used for hard-to-reach groups (e.g., intravenous drug users).

## Scientific Method

The scientific method is a structured approach scientists use to investigate and understand natural phenomena. It involves:

1. **Observation and Question Formulation**: Identifying a problem or question based on observations.
2. **Data Collection and Hypothesis**: Gathering data and forming a hypothesis.
3. **Testing the Hypothesis**: Conducting experiments to test the hypothesis.
4. **Analysis and Conclusion**: Analyzing the results to draw conclusions that confirm or challenge the initial hypothesis.

This method helps ensure that scientific inquiries are systematic and objective.

# Quantitative Research Methods and Techniques

## Overview

Quantitative research methods are used to observe and analyze numerical data that affects a specific group of individuals, known as the sample population. This data is collected through various methods and statistically analyzed to identify patterns, relationships, or trends. Key methods include questionnaires, structured observations, and experiments.

### Examples of Quantitative Research Techniques

1. **Satisfaction Surveys**: A company sends out surveys to customers asking them to rate their experience on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
2. **Feedback Questionnaires**: A school sends out questionnaires to parents to assess the success of a new after-school program, often using yes/no or multiple-choice questions.

## Primary and Secondary Research Methods

### Primary Research Methods

Primary research involves collecting new data directly from original sources.

#### Examples:

- **Surveys**: Asking a group of people about their preferred mode of transportation.
- **Experiments**: Testing the impact of different study techniques on students' exam scores.
- **Observational Studies**: Watching shoppers' behavior in a store to understand their purchasing habits.

### Secondary Research Methods

Secondary research uses existing data that was collected for other purposes.

#### Examples:

- **Literature Reviews**: Analyzing previous studies on a topic, such as the effects of climate change on biodiversity.
- **Data Analysis**: Using government data on unemployment rates to understand economic trends.
- **Meta-analysis**: Combining data from multiple studies to assess the effectiveness of a treatment.

## Quantitative Research Design

Quantitative research design focuses on answering research questions to develop new theories or expand existing ones. Key considerations include the overall aims, data collection methods and procedures, sample selection criteria, bias prevention, and data analysis.

### Examples of Quantitative Survey Design Types

- **Cross-Sectional Surveys**: Conducted at a single point in time to analyze current trends or opinions.
